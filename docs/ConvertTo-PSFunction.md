# ConvertTo-PSFunction

## SYNOPSIS
Function to "convert" legacy command line commands to PowerShell functions ConvertTo-PSFunction.ps1

## Script file
ConvertTo-PSFunction.ps1

## SYNTAX

```
ConvertTo-PSFunction [[-nativeCommands] <String[]>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The function creates dynamically functions that call legacy commands which support the output
format csv (/fo csv).
The new functions pass all provided switches + "/fo csv" to the legacy command and 
pipe the output to ConverFrom-CSV in order to receive PowerShell objects.
The names of the dynamically created functions consist of the prefix "PS" and the name of the command.
